Here I'm curating a list of all Open Source Web Apps that is easy to browse by category.

I'm doing it in Jekyll mostly because I wanted to see what type of data driven website could be built as a static site within the limitations of Jekyll.

Feel free to add new apps to the repository by just sending a pull request to https://github.com/opensourcewebapps/opensourcewebapps.github.io
