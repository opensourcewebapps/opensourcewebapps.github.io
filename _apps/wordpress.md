WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. We like to say that WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.
The core software is built by hundreds of community volunteers, and when youâ€™re ready for more there are thousands of plugins and themes available to transform your site into almost anything you can imagine.
